## What is Dog for a Day?

**Dog for a Day** is a web application that allows dog owners to loan out their pet to those who love dogs but are unable to own one.

If you are anything like me (Freddie (see contributors)) you love dogs but don't get enough of them in your life. Dog for a Day was created to allow people like me to spend a weekend, day, or afternoon taking a lovable dog out for a walk, play session, or to just spending quality time with humankind's best friend.

If you're a dog owner, it's a platform for you to find a trustworthy animal lover to look after your pooch over a weekend or during any time where you're not able to give it the attention or walks it needs.

## Project Status

### 02/04/2021
Find Mike is the first team project from a team of new coders on batch #476 of [Le Wagon's](https://www.lewagon.com/) part-time full-stack webdevelopment course. As such, we are presently not looking for other contributors and will continue developing the app as a team.

We have no plans to push Dog for a Day to prodiuction as it was simply a learning excercise to practice our coding skills. We will however continue to polish the front end so Dog for a Day will stand as a portfolio piece we can be proud of.
